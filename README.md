    vault-plugin-secrets-nats extends Hashicorp Vault with a secrets engine for NATS.

# About The Project

`vault-plugin-secrets-nats` is a Hashicorp Vault plugin that extends Vault with a secrets engine for [NATS](https://nats.io) for Nkey/JWT auth. 
It is capable of generating NATS credentials for operators, accounts and users. The generated credentials are stored in Vault and can be revoked at any time.
The plugin is also able to push the generated credentials to a NATS account server. 

A similar project is the [`nsc` tool by NATS](https://github.com/nats-io/nsc) but the `nsc` tool doesn't provide a way to store the generated credentials other than file based. The `nsc` tool is not automated and heavily relies on manual steps.

## Features

- Manage NATS nkey and jwt for operators, accounts and users
- Give access to user creds files
- Push generated credentials to a NATS account server

# Getting Started

The `nats` secrets engine generates NATS credentials dynamically.
The plugin supports several resources, including: operators, accounts, users, NKeys, JWTs and creds, as well as signing keys for operators an accounts.

There is a command structure to create, read update and delete operators, accounts, users and permissions based on entity paths.
Please read the official [NATS documentation](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/jwt) to understand the concepts of operators, accounts and users as well as the authentication process.
A hand full of resources can be defined within the vault plugin:

The resource of type `issue` represent entities that result in generation of nkey and JWTs.

| Entity path                                                   | Description                                                                        | Operations          |

| issue/operator/\<operator\>/account/\<account\>/user/\<name\> | Manage user issues within an account. See the `user` section for more information. | write, read, delete |

The resources of type `creds` represent user credentials that can be used to authenticate against a NATS server.

| Entity path                                                 | Description       | Operations          |

## ⚙️ Configuration

There are arguments that can be passed to the paths for `issue/` (operator, account, user), `creds/`, `jwt/` and `nkey/`.

### Issues

Issues can be created with an imported nkey. If the nkey is not present during the creation of the issue, a new nkey will be generated.
**Note: if you don't provide any claims for an operator, account or user, the plugin will generate a default set of claims. The default claims are set to "you are not allowed to do anything".**

## 🎯 Installation and Setup

In order to use this plugin you need to register it with Vault.
Configure your vault server to have a valid `plugins_directory` configuration. 

**Note: you might want to set `api_addr` to your listening address and `disable_mlock` to `true` in the `vault` configuration to be able to use the plugin.**

### Install from release

Download the latest stable release from the [release]() page and put it into the `plugins_directory` of your vault server.

```console
SHA256SUM=$(sha256sum vault-plugin-secrets-nats | cut -d' ' -f1)
vault plugin register -sha256 ${SHA256SUM} secret vault-plugin-secrets-nats
vault secrets enable -path=nats-secrets vault-plugin-secrets-nats
```

**Note: you might use the `-tls-skip-verify` flag if you are using a self-signed certificate.**

### Install from OCI image using bank-vaults in Kubernetes

This project provides a custom built `vault` OCI image that includes the `vault-plugin-secrets-nats` plugin. See [here]() for available versions.
The `plugins_directory` must be set to `/etc/vault/vault_plugins` in the `vault` configuration.

This describes the steps to install the plugin using the `bank-vaults` operator. See [here](https://banzaicloud.com/docs/bank-vaults/operator/) for more information.
Define the custom `vault` image in the `Vault` custom resource and configure 

```yaml
apiVersion: "vault.banzaicloud.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Vault"
metadata:
  name: "myVault"
spec:
  size: 1
  # Use the custom vault image containing the NATS secrets plugin
  image: ghcr.io/edgefarm/vault-plugin-secrets-nats/vault-with-nats-secrets:latest
  config:
    disable_mlock: true
    plugin_directory: "/etc/vault/vault_plugins"
    listener:
      tcp:
        address: "0.0.0.0:8200"
    api_addr: "https://0.0.0.0:8200"
  externalConfig:
    plugins:
    - plugin_name: vault-plugin-secrets-nats
      command: vault-plugin-secrets-nats --tls-skip-verify --ca-cert=/vault/tls/ca.crt
      sha256: be9598c2cda1d58eed933def71290b1ae7c57a15fcecc0d1bbf320bd14df0b6e
      type: secret
    secrets:
    - path: nats-secrets
      type: plugin
      plugin_name: vault-plugin-secrets-nats
      description: NATS secrets backend
  # ...
```

See the fule [dev/manifests/vault/vault.yaml](dev/manifests/vault/vault.yaml) for a full example of a `Vault` custom resource that can be used by the `vault-operator`.

## 🧪 Testing

To test the plugin in a production like environment you can spin up a local kind cluster that runs a production `vault` server with the plugin enabled and a NATS server the plugin writes account information to.

**Note: you need to have `kind` and `devspace` installed.**

The first step is to spin up the cluster with everything installed.

```console
# Create the cluster
$ devspace run create-kind-cluster

# Deploy initial stuff like ingress and cert-manager
$ devspace run-pipeline init 

# Deploy the vault-operator and vault instance
$ devspace run-pipeline deploy-vault

# Wait for the vault pods get ready
$ kubectl get pods -n vault 

# Check if the plugin is successfully loaded
$ kubectl port-forward -n vault svc/vault 8200:8200 &
$ PID=$!
$ export VAULT_ADDR=https://127.0.0.1:8200
$ VAULT_TOKEN=$(kubectl get secrets bank-vaults -n vault -o jsonpath='{.data.vault-root}' | base64 -d)
$ echo $VAULT_TOKEN | vault login -
$ vault secrets list
Handling connection for 8200
Path             Type                         Accessor                              Description
----             ----                         --------                              -----------
cubbyhole/       cubbyhole                    cubbyhole_ec217496                    per-token private secret storage
identity/        identity                     identity_9123b895                     identity store
nats-secrets/    vault-plugin-secrets-nats    vault-plugin-secrets-nats_d8584dcc    NATS secrets backend
sys/             system                       system_5bd0e10f                       system endpoints used for control, policy and debugging
$ pkill $PID

# Deploy the NATS server
$ devspace run-pipeline deploy-nats

# Wait for the NATS server to be ready
$ kubectl get pods -n nats
```

Once this is working create a account and a user and act as a third party that uses the creds outside the cluster.

```console
# Create the account and user and get the creds for the user
$ devspace run-pipeline test-custom-nats-account
$ kubectl port-forward -n nats svc/nats 4222:4222 &
$ PID=$!

# Publish and subscribe using the creds previously fetched
$ docker run -it -d --rm --name nats-subscribe --network host -v $(pwd)/.devspace/creds/creds:/creds natsio/nats-box:0.13.4 nats sub -s nats://localhost:4222 --creds /creds foo 
$ docker run --rm -d -it --name nats-publish --network host -v $(pwd)/.devspace/creds/creds:/creds natsio/nats-box:0.13.4 nats pub -s nats://localhost:4222 --creds /creds foo --count 3 "Message {{Count}} @ {{Time}}"

# Log output shows that authenticating with the creds file works for pub and sub
$ docker logs nats-subscribe
14:49:35 Subscribing on foo 
[#1] Received on "foo"
Message 1 @ 2:49PM

[#2] Received on "foo"
Message 2 @ 2:49PM

[#3] Received on "foo"
Message 3 @ 2:49PM

# Cleanup
$ docker kill nats-subscribe
$ pkill $PID

```

# 💡 Example

Read this section to learn how to use `vault-plugin-secrets-nats` by trying out the example. 
See the `example` directory for a full example. The example runs a locally running Vault server and a NATS server.

An operator and a sys account is created. Both are using signing keys. A sys account user called `default-push` is created 
that is used to push the credentials to the NATS account server.
The NATS server is configured to use the generated credentials.
After the NATS server is up and running a new "normal" account and a user is created and pushed to the NATS server.
The user is then able to connect to the NATS server.

Note: please make sure that you have `docker` installed as the example starts a local NATS server using docker.

## Setup

To use the plugin, you must first enable it with Vault. This example mounts the plugin at the path `nats-secrets`:

First run `make` to start a Vault server in dev mode that is pre-configured to use the plugin.

```console
$ make
```

Then, enable the plugin:

```console
$ export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
$ vault secrets enable -path=nats-secrets vault-plugin-secrets-nats
Success! Enabled the vault-plugin-secrets-nats secrets engine at: nats-secrets/
```

## Run the example

```console
$ cd examples
$ ./config.sh
